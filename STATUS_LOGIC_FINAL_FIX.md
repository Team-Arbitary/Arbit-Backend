# Status Logic Fix - Final Correction

## Issue Found
The status logic was incorrect. When only one image (baseline) was uploaded, the system was returning "In Progress" instead of "Not Started".

## Corrected Status Logic

### Previous (Wrong) Logic:
- "Not Started": Neither baseline nor thermal image uploaded
- "In Progress": Only one image uploaded OR both uploaded but analysis not completed  
- "Completed": Both images uploaded AND analysis completed

### New (Correct) Logic:
- **"Not Started"**: Either no images uploaded OR only one image uploaded (need BOTH to start)
- **"In Progress"**: Both images uploaded but analysis not completed yet
- **"Completed"**: Both images uploaded AND analysis completed (result exists)

## Code Changes Applied

### Before:
```java
// If neither image is uploaded
if (!hasBaseline && !hasThermal) {
    return "Not Started";
}

// If only one image is uploaded
if (!hasBaseline || !hasThermal) {
    return "In Progress";  // ❌ WRONG
}
```

### After:
```java
// If neither image is uploaded OR only one image is uploaded
if (!hasBaseline || !hasThermal) {
    return "Not Started";  // ✅ CORRECT
}
```

## Business Logic Reasoning
- **Inspection cannot begin** until BOTH baseline and thermal images are available
- **"Not Started"** means the inspection is not ready to begin (missing required images)
- **"In Progress"** means all prerequisites are met and analysis is underway
- **"Completed"** means the full workflow is finished with results available

## Test Scenarios
1. **No images**: "Not Started" ✅
2. **Only baseline image**: "Not Started" ✅  
3. **Only thermal image**: "Not Started" ✅
4. **Both images, no analysis**: "In Progress" ✅
5. **Both images + analysis results**: "Completed" ✅

## Backend Status
✅ **Application restarted** with corrected logic
✅ **Enhanced logging** for debugging status decisions
✅ **Ready for testing** at `http://localhost:5509`

The status calculation now correctly reflects the business requirement that both images are needed to begin the inspection process.
