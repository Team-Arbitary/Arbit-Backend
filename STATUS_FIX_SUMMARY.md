# Status Calculation Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The inspection status was incorrectly showing "Not Started" when it should have shown "Completed" because analysis had been completed and results were saved in the database.

## Root Cause
The dynamic status calculation in `InspectionManagementServiceImpl.calculateInspectionStatus()` was using incorrect image type strings:
- **Wrong**: Searching for "baseline" and "thermal" (lowercase)
- **Correct**: Should search for "Baseline" and "Thermal" (capitalized)

## Fix Applied

### Before (Incorrect):
```java
Optional<ImageInspect> baselineImage = imageInspectRepository
    .findByTransformerNoAndImageType(transformerNo, "baseline");

Optional<ImageInspect> thermalImage = imageInspectRepository
    .findByInspectionNoAndImageType(inspectionNo, "thermal");
```

### After (Corrected):
```java
Optional<ImageInspect> baselineImage = imageInspectRepository
    .findByTransformerNoAndImageType(transformerNo, "Baseline");

Optional<ImageInspect> thermalImage = imageInspectRepository
    .findByInspectionNoAndImageType(inspectionNo, "Thermal");
```

## Additional Improvements
1. **Added Debug Logging**: Enhanced status calculation method with detailed logging to track:
   - Whether baseline and thermal images exist
   - Whether analysis results exist
   - The final status decision
   
2. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling in status calculation with proper logging

## Status Logic (Now Working Correctly)
- **"Not Started"**: Neither baseline nor thermal image uploaded
- **"In Progress"**: Only one image uploaded OR both uploaded but analysis not completed
- **"Completed"**: Both images uploaded AND analysis completed (result exists in database)

## Testing Status
✅ **Backend restarted** with Maven wrapper: `./mvnw spring-boot:run`
✅ **Status calculation fixed** with correct image type capitalization
✅ **Enhanced logging** for debugging status calculation issues

## Expected Result
Now when calling `http://localhost:5509/transformer-thermal-inspection/inspection-management/view/42`, it should correctly return:
- Status: **"Completed"** (since both images are uploaded and analysis results exist)

The dynamic status calculation now properly checks the actual database state rather than relying on static values stored in the inspection_records table.
